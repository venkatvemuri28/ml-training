# Ticket Summarization Model Training

This repository contains everything you need to train a model that generates concise and improved summaries from detailed ticket descriptions. This project leverages the T5 model from Hugging Face Transformers and includes scripts for data preparation and model training.

## Project Overview

Many customer support tickets contain lengthy descriptions that can benefit from concise, automated summaries. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-text model (T5), we can automatically generate high-quality summaries, helping support teams quickly assess issues and prioritize tasks.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Libraries:**
  - `transformers`
  - `datasets`
  - `pandas`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets pandas
